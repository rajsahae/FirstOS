Small tutorial on how to write your own operating system

I had to modify some of the compilation/linking because I was compiling
on my laptop, which is runing x86_64, and not 32-bit Ubuntu.
I'm also currently having trouble loading the os.img into my VirtualBox.
It's giving me some sort of error about how the image is an unrecognizable
format. I wonder if it's saying that because the size is not exactly 1440 KiB,
or whatever it expects a floppy disk image to be.
